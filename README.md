# Pionnière 
_The_ colonization modpack!

Pionnière is a modpack for Minecraft version 1.16.5 about constructing and maintaining colonies!
This was made for the person who thinks herding vanilla villagers are too damn boring.
### Features
- Fantasy-themed (complete with magic!)
- Multiple colony management mods to choose from.
- Hours of replayablility!

This modpack is fairly complicated for someone who's not familiar with the mods. Fret not though, because there is a handy dandy tutorial built in for each of the colony management mods.

## If you see this this means that the README (and subsequently the project) is NOT finished yet!
